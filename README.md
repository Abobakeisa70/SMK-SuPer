## SMK Frontend Setup 

This guide will help you set up and run the frontend of this MERN stack project.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Recommended: Latest LTS version)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (Package managers)
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Getting Started

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EDOHWARES/SMK-SuPer
```

#### 2. Navigate to the Client Directory
```bash
cd smk-super/client
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### 4. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Notes
- Replace `smk-super` with the actual path to your project directory if necessary.
- Ensure that the backend server is running if the frontend depends on it.

The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:5173/ (default Vite port).
